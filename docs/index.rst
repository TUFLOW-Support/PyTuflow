Welcome to pytuflow's documentation!
====================================

**pytuflow** is a library that acts as an API for your TUFLOW model. It allows easy interaction with the model results,
contains a number of useful utilities for building TUFLOW models, and contains some useful parsers for files within the
TUFLOW eco-system.

Check out the :doc:`usage` section for further information, including how to :ref:`install <installation>` the project.
