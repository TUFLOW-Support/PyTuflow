Outputs
=======

TUFLOW outputs and check files. The :code:`outputs` module acts as an abstraction
library for TUFLOW outputs (and check files and some inputs) that provides common interfacing methods for loading and
querying outputs.

The classes listed below are the top level classes that act as entry points to load results / check files.
